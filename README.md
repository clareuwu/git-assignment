**Why I found it interesting**:

This article talks about the decline if Google's search engine, and the underrated aspect of Reddit as a search engine. I thought this was a good article as I've felt myself feeling the same frustrations as the author in the past couple of years at least. Most google searches for product information or recommendations especially is just filled with marketer-optimized garbage and affiliate links trying to get you to buy *anything* they talk about on their website. 

Whenever I want actual opinions from real humans I tend to do what the author does and add 'reddit' to the end of any searches I make. It's not perfect since companies do do some undercover advertising on Reddit too but I've found it a lot more helpful in general. It's been really frustrating not being able to trust Google searches by and large anymore, so it's nice to know I'm not the only one thinking this.
